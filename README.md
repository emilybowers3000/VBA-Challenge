# Module 2 Challenge
In this activity, I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for the year and outputs the following information in a summary table on the same worksheet:
The Ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
Percent change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
Total stock volume 
Color code yearly change and percent change based on values, positive change color coded green, negative change color coded in red.

Great a third summary table that shows the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume. Display the ticker symbol and the values for each element.
